# Ginny!

![Ginny](https://assets.bigcartel.com/product_images/247416878/IMG_20191025_1424438-01.jpeg)

Quite possibly the smallest, most feature-filled board you can fit in your pocket.

With multi-language onboard ASETNIOP and all sorts of fun shenanigans.

This board is more than a novelty, it's an ergonomic wonder!

## Firmware Building
Clone the QMK repo and submodules, then run the install script: ([Newbs Getting Started Guide](https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/newbs/newbs_getting_started))

    # if needed, uncomment && update '<repository URL>' with the correct URL.
    # git clone --recurse-submodules <repository URL>
    
    # if needed, uncomment && checkout the appropriate branch.
    # git checkout <branch-to-be-flashed>
    
    cd qmk_firmware
    util/qmk_install.sh

Install `dfu-programmer` using your package manager if the `qmk_install.sh` script did not.

    # Ubuntu/Debian    
    sudo apt install dfu-programmer
    # RedHat/CentOS
    sudo yum install dfu-programmer
    # etc...

Build and flash with the command below. Be sure to reset your keyboard!

    make ginny:default:flash

To just test your build with the default keymap:
   
    make ginny:default

Ginny supports many different languages, these can be configured in your keymap.c includes. Please set them!
